# Advanced Query quickstart: Get transaction history for an Ethereum address

QT's Advanced Query APIs (beta) allow you to simplify and optimize common request types to make developing on the blockchain easier.

In this quickstart you will get the full transaction history for a smart contract or a user address including external, internal, token, ERC-20 and ERC-721 token transfers in a single request.

Why get address transaction history by an address?
- Display a user's full transaction history
- Query an address's transactions filtered by smart contract interactions 
- Analyze a user's historical profit and loss

## Prerequisites

- A Coinbase Cloud account


## Create a project and get API keys

To get started using the new Query & Transact Advanced Query beta APIs, sign in to your Coinbase Cloud account:

### Create project

After you sign in you'll be prompted to set up your first project. A project provides access to a shared node (Ethereum Mainnet only for beta) where you can make Ethereum calls and calls to the Advanced Query APIs. 

Select the Free tier plan (Free-tier only for beta) and enter a name for your project.

### Get API keys

After creating a project, you'll be taken to the project overview page. 

  <img src="/project-overview.png" alt="Create a project screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

This page gives key information about your project, including:
- Endpoint
- API Access Token Username (e.g. username)
- API Access Token Password (e.g. password)

Copy your endpoint, username, and password to your machine. 

> ⚠️ You can return to this page to retrieve your endpoint and username, but your password is **not saved**. 
>
> **If you lose your project password, you will need to create a new project.**
