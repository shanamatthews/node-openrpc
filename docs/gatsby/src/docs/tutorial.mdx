# Advanced APIs tutorial: Get transaction history for an Ethereum address

Query and Transact (QT) Advanced APIs (preview) allow you to simplify and optimize common types of Ethereum requests.
These APIs supplement the basic [Ethereum node JSON-RPC APIs](https://main.d11a9x012jyl0p.amplifyapp.com/ethereum-documentation/), available from any Ethereum node provider, making it so you have to make fewer API calls to get the data you want, and making developing on the blockchain easier.

In this tutorial you will get the full transaction history for a user address including external, internal, token, ERC-20 and ERC-721 token transfers in a single request.

Why get address transaction history?
- Display a user's full transaction history
- Query an address's transactions filtered by smart contract interactions 
- Analyze a user's historical profit and loss

## Prerequisites

- A Coinbase Cloud account with access to the preview
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed

## Create a project and get API keys

To get started using the new Query & Transact Advanced APIs preview, [sign in to your Coinbase Cloud account](https://console.cloud.coinbase.com/):

<img src="/sign-in.png" alt="Sign in to Coinbase Cloud Console screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

### Create project

After you sign in you'll be prompted to set up your first project. A project provides access to a shared node (Ethereum Mainnet only for preview) where you can make Ethereum calls and calls to the QT Advanced APIs. 

Select the free tier plan (free-tier only for preview) and enter a name for your project.

<img src="/create-project.png" alt="Create a project screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

### Get API keys

After creating a project, you'll be taken to the project overview page. 

  <img src="/project-overview.png" alt="Create a project screen" width="60%" class="ImageBorder" />

This page gives key information about your project, including:
- Endpoint
- API Access Token Username (e.g. username)
- API Access Token Password (e.g. password)

Copy your endpoint, username, and password to your machine. 

> ⚠️ You can return to this page to retrieve your endpoint and username, but your password is **not saved**. 
>
> **If you lose your project password, you will need to create a new project.**

## Make a request and process the response

Now, you will use the information you copied to make a request to the Advanced APIs.

### Make request

Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `username`, and `password` with the values you copied from the Console. 

For preview, the API endpoint is the same across all projects.

```json
curl https://868605ce-acde-424e-800c-55ab87808268.ethereum.bison.run/ \
  -u username:password \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "method": "coinbaseCloud_getTransactionsByAddress",
  "params": {
    "address": "0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699",
    "blockStart": 15132913,
    "blockEnd": 15135958,
    "addressFilter": "RECEIVER_ONLY",
    "blockchain": "Ethereum",
    "network":"Mainnet"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

This call to `getTransactionsByAddress` specifies:

|param|value|explanation|
|-|-|-|
|`address`|`"0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699"`|the Ethereum address you're retrieving transactions for|
|`blockStart`|`15132913`|the block number to start scanning for transactions|
|`blockEnd`|`15135958`|the block number to stop scanning for transactions. Optional, defaults to the latest block.|
|`addressFilter`|`"RECEIVER_ONLY"`|filters returned transactions to sender or receiver if specified. Optional, defaults to `"SENDER_OR_RECEIVER"`|
|`blockchain`|`"Ethereum"`|Ethereum-only in preview. Optional, defaults to `"Ethereum"`|
|`network`|`"Mainnet"`|Mainnet-only in preview. Optional, defaults to `"Mainnet"`|


### Get the response

You should get a JSON response back that looks similar to this:

### Understand the response

This response gives a list of blocks in which transactions were found. Each block includes the list of external transactions found for that address in that block.
Since we specified `"RECEIVER_ONLY"`, the returned transactions will include only those which the specified address was the recipient.

The response returns a lot of information, we will only cover the highlights here. See the [API docs](https://main.d11a9x012jyl0p.amplifyapp.com/api-documentation/) for full documentation of the response values. 

- `blockStart`: the block number this response starts at
- `blockEnd`: the block number this response ends at
  - If >1000 transactions would be returned for the requested block range, this API will return 1000+ transactions in a smaller block range (specified by `blockStart` and `blockEnd` in the result) such that all blocks returned are complete (i.e. contain all requested transactions)
  - This is covered in more detail in the next section, "Handle pagination"
- `blocks`: the list of blocks containing transactions:
  - `transactions`: a list of relevant transactions in this block
    - `from`: origin address
    - `to`: destination address
    - `value`: value in native blockchain currency
    - `status`: "Success", "Failure", or "Unknown"

### Handle pagination

Note that in your API call, you requested transactions from block **15132913** to **15135958**, but the response only included blocks **15132927** to **15135958**.
This is because the API response is paginated when there are more than 1000 transactions in the requested block range. 
If you were to scroll through the full response in your console and count the transactions, you'll see over 1000 transactions returned from this call (1004 to be specific).

To get the rest of the transactions, we'll need to note the returned block range, and make additional API calls to cover the rest of the desired bock range.

> Both of the following API calls pipe the response to a utility called `jq` to format it before we save it to a file.
> We'll discuss `jq` further in the next section.

First, save the response from the previous API call in a file named **response1.json**:

```json
curl https://868605ce-acde-424e-800c-55ab87808268.ethereum.bison.run/ \
  -u username:password \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "method": "coinbaseCloud_getTransactionsByAddress",
  "params": {
    "address": "0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699",
    "blockStart": 15132913,
    "blockEnd": 15135958,
    "addressFilter": "RECEIVER_ONLY",
    "blockchain": "Ethereum",
    "network":"Mainnet"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}' | jq '.' > response1.json
```

Then, make a second API call to get the rest of the transactions and save it into a file named **response2.json**

```json
curl https://868605ce-acde-424e-800c-55ab87808268.ethereum.bison.run/ \
  -u username:password \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "method": "coinbaseCloud_getTransactionsByAddress",
  "params": {
    "address": "0x3cd751e6b0078be393132286c442345e5dc49699",
    "blockStart": 15132913,
    "blockEnd": 15132926,
    "addressFilter": "RECEIVER_ONLY",
    "blockchain": "Ethereum",
    "network":"Mainnet"
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}' | jq '.' > response2.json
```


### Process the response

For any given purpose, we may only be interested in a subset of this information, or we may have a specific question we'd like answered. 
For this example, we'll find any sender addresses this address has received exactly 4 transactions from. 

In this tutorial we'll be using the command line utility `jq` to answer our question quickly and easily from the command line, but you can use any programming language or tools you'd like to process JSON.

#### Combine our API call responses 

To start answering our question (*Which senders have sent this address exactly 4 transactions?*), we'll start by combining our two files into one unified set of transactions. 

Run the following command to create a new file, **combined.json** that merges the block data from **response1.json** and **response2.json** into one array:

```
jq -s '[.[].result.blocks[]]' response1.json response2.json > combined.json
```

The previous command finds all the objects in the `blocks` array inside the result object in **response1.json** and **response2.json**, combining them into one object in **combined.json**.

#### Filter down our results

Next, run this command to strip down our data to only the sender (`from`) and amount (`value`) of each top-level transaction: 

```
cat combined.json | jq '[.[].transactions[] | { from: .from, value: .value }]' > transactions-only.json
```

The previous command finds all objects in each `transactions` array and outputs only the `from` and `value` properties into new objects, combining them into one object in **transactions-only.json**.

Finally, we'll group the transactions by sender (`from`) and filter the results down to only senders that have more than 4 transactions:

```
cat transactions-only.json | jq '[group_by(.from)[] | select(length == 4)]' > final.json
```

**Output:**

```json
[
  [
    {
      "from": "0xe657d33ca8da35371cdcdaf59825960f9ac5c065",
      "value": "1083477288637051"
    },
    {
      "from": "0xe657d33ca8da35371cdcdaf59825960f9ac5c065",
      "value": "968395367702029"
    },
    {
      "from": "0xe657d33ca8da35371cdcdaf59825960f9ac5c065",
      "value": "1115081972116448"
    },
    {
      "from": "0xe657d33ca8da35371cdcdaf59825960f9ac5c065",
      "value": "30799763086632415"
    }
  ]
]
```

There's only one address that has sent our recipient address exactly 4 transactions: "0xe657d33ca8da35371cdcdaf59825960f9ac5c065".

You did it! You now know how to get transaction history for a given Ethereum address and analyze the resulting response data. From here, you can process more information from your response or check out other [Advanced APIs]((https://main.d11a9x012jyl0p.amplifyapp.com/api-documentation/)).
